# Node-Express-Handlebars: Burger App
![Project license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

The goal was to create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM, by following the MVC design pattern, using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML. 

Bottomless-Burgers is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. The app involves the following functionalities:
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
